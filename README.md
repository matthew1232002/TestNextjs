# **Test project**

**Project for resume**

At the root of the project is the pages folder.  Next to pages is the components folder.  In the components folder you will find layout (MainNavigation), api, comments, posts etc.  Also in the root of the project is the styles folder with styled button and the models for typescript models folder. I have used styled-components , so the styles folder is on the same level as a  matching component.

NextJs, REST API, styled-components , TypeScript, React Hooks.

`npm install`   -  **to install dependencies**

`npm run dev`  - **to run the server**

In this app you can add a post and write a comment to it
